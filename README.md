# Aniket Rathour

Undergraduate Computer Science student (B.Tech, 2029)  
Focused on **machine learning systems, mathematical foundations of deep learning, and research-grade implementations**.

📍 New Delhi, India  
🎯 Actively preparing for **research engineer / applied research roles (international)**  

## Why this GitHub exists

This GitHub documents my long-term transition from a full-stack developer
to a **research-oriented machine learning engineer**.

My focus is not on quick demos or library-heavy projects, but on:
- deriving algorithms from first principles,
- implementing them from scratch,
- reproducing published results,
- and understanding *why* systems fail.

Most repositories here are part of a structured, multi-year research roadmap.

## Flagship Work

### 🔬 Research-Oriented Implementations
- **MNIST-LinearOptimizer**  
  Vectorized softmax classifier in pure NumPy.  
  Includes full gradient derivation, training curves, and generalization analysis.

- **KNN-ImageClassifier (CS231n)**  
  CIFAR-10 classifier with fully vectorized distance computation and
  bias–variance analysis via cross-validation.

### 🧠 Systems & Engineering
- **Drona-Sphere**  
  MERN-based social networking platform focused on concurrency,
  latency, and modular backend architecture.

- **Anikzzzy-Wallet**  
  Digital wallet system exploring transaction integrity and system reliability.
